              Verif AI is a Montreal-based startup committed to bringing
              transparency to the obscure world of Terms & Conditions and
              Privacy Policies. We provide the most relevant information to
              consumers, so that they can make better decisions individually,
              and collectively influence the market. Using the power of
              Artificial Intelligence, our solution “reads” this endless and
              illegible text and brings the most important points to your
              attention.
