This is the website I built using React.js during my internship at the Verifa.i. 
The project has allowed me to explore different aspects of React as a powerful javascript library.
While working on this project, I realized how well-organized the react architecture is and how many options react provides for designing a user interface.Yet for my next project I will probably use a server-side rendering tool such as next.js in order to deal with SEO problems.
